Since the twentieth century, astronomers have accumulated conclusive evidence that the content of the Universe is mostly of unknown origin and that the ordinary matter, baryonic matter, constitutes tiny fraction of the energy-density of the Universe -- only 5\%. The remaining bulk of the Universe is composed from 70\% of a dark energy causing the accelerated expansion of the Universe, whereas 25\% is in a form of a dark matter causing the formation of the structures in the Universe. Dark energy ranks as one of the most important discoveries in cosmology, with profound implications for astronomy and fundamental physics.

With the measurement of an accelerated rate of expansion of the Universe, various alternatives to standard Einstein's theory of gravity have been suggested in order to explain the acceleration, attempting to bypass problems connected to the cosmological constant. These theories usually add some new degrees of freedom, either in a form of new fields or by modifying existing fields.

There are many different ways how to study the dark energy (or modified gravity), e.g. through growth of structures on large scales and consequent formation of cluster and galaxies on smaller scales, bending of light in the Universe or baryonic oscillations in the early Universe.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, previously referred to as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), is a ground-based telescope being built in northern Chile. Thanks to a large aperture, wide field survey telescope and 3200 Megapixel camera it will image faint astronomical objects across the sky. The LSST will rapidly scan the sky, charting objects that change or move: from exploding supernovae to potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids. The LSST will produce very deep survey and its images will trace billions of remote galaxies, providing multiple probes of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy.

Throughout this work we use units such that $c=\hbar=k_B=1$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $\hbar$ is reduced Planck`s constant, and $k_B$ is Boltzmann`s constant.The gravitational constant $G$ is related to the Planck mass $\mpl=1.2211\times10^{19}$ GeV via $G=1/\mpl^2$ and the reduced Planck mass $\Mpl = 2.4357\times10^{18}$ GeV via $\kappa^2\equiv8\pi G=1/\Mpl^2$ respectively. We list frequently used symbols after the Table of Contents. We adopt the metric signature $(-, +, +, +)$. The Greek indices such as $\mu$ and $\nu$ run from 0 to 3 whereas the Latin indices such as $i$ and $j$ run from 1 to 3. When referring to present values of quantities we use subscript $0$, e.g. $H_0$ to denote the present value of the Hubble parameter.
