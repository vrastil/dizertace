\section*{Units and conventions}
Throughout this work we use units such that $c=\hbar=k_B=1$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $\hbar$ is reduced Planck`s constant, and $k_B$ is Boltzmann`s constant.The gravitational constant $G$ is related to the Planck mass $\mpl=1.2211\times10^{19}$ GeV via $G=1/\mpl^2$ and the reduced Planck mass $\Mpl = 2.4357\times10^{18}$ GeV via $\kappa^2\equiv8\pi G=1/\Mpl^2$ respectively. We adopt the metric signature $(-, +, +, +)$. We list frequently used symbols after the Table of Contents.
