\chapter{Cosmological Evolution}
\label{chpt:cosmo_evol}
In this chapter we briefly describe the evolution of the Universe. For more comprehensive lectures see e.g. \textcite{Ref:Weinberg}, \textcite{2002col.luc..cosmology} or \textcite{2010deto.book.....A}. We begin with basic equations for the evolution and apply them to cosmological scales. We describe background evolution and formation of structures in the \LCDM\ model and we briefly mention non--linear cosmological perturbations. At the end of the chapter, we introduce some basic cosmological observables that are often used to put observational constraints on dark energy.

\section{Background evolution}
The standard cosmological model is based on the \textit{cosmological principle}, first clearly formulated in \textcite{1687pnpm.book.....N}. The cosmological principle states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales (beyond those traced by the large--scale structure of the distribution of galaxies). The cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations strongly support this statement as photons from different parts of the Universe are coming with almost identical temperatures. This isotropy, however, does not imply homogeneity. The \textit{Copernican Principle} states that the observer is not in a special place or time. With the observed isotropy, the Copernican Principle implies the Cosmological Principle. The observed inhomogeneities and irregularities on local scales come from gravitational instability and do not violate these principles.
