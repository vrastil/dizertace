% \subsection{Friedmann equations}
The~homogeneous and~isotropic space-time is described by the~Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric given by
\eq{
    \label{eq:flrw}
    \dd s^2=g_\uv\dd x^\mu \dd x^\nu=-\dd t^2+a^2(t)\left[\frac{\dd r^2}{1-Kr^2} + r^2\left(\dd\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\dd\phi^2 \right) \right]\,,
}
where $g_{\mu\nu}$ is a~metric tensor, $a(t)$ is a~scale factor with~cosmic time $t$ and~$K=+1,-1,0$ is a~curvature that corresponds to~closed, open, and~flat geometries. The~scale factor can be arbitrarily rescaled and~we adopt the~common normalization $a_0=1$. From the~Einstein equations of~motion in~the~expanding Universe one can derive the~Friedmann equations
\eq{
    \label{eq:Friedmann}
    H^2 &= \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{K}{a^2}+\frac{\Lambda}{3}\,, \\
    \label{eq:Friedmann_2}
    \frac{\ddot a}{a} &= -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho + 3p)+\frac{\Lambda}{3}\,,\\
    \label{eq:Friedmann-continuity}
    \dot\rho &= -3H(\rho+p)\,,
}
where the~overdot denotes a~time derivative with~respect to~$t$, $H\equiv\dot a/a$ is the~Hubble parameter, $\Lambda$ the~cosmological constant, $\rho(t)$ is energy-density and~$p$ pressure. These three equations are not independent and~we need to~also specify the~equation of~state, $\rho=\rho(p,t)$. The~first equation is usually also written in~the~form
\eq{
    \Omega_m+\Omega_\gamma+\Omega_K+\Omega_\Lambda=1\,,
}
where
\eq{
    \label{eq:omega}
    \Omega_m\equiv\frac{8\pi G\rho_m}{3H^2}\,,\hspace{3pt}
    \Omega_\gamma\equiv\frac{8\pi G\rho_\gamma}{3H^2}\,,\hspace{3pt}
    \Omega_K\equiv-\frac{K}{a^2H^2}\,,\hspace{3pt}
    \Omega_\Lambda\equiv\frac{\Lambda}{3H^2}
}

Most matter species in~the~Universe can be described by a~simple equation of~state
\eq{
    p=w\rho\,,
}
where $w$ is constant. This lead to~the~following solutions in~a~flat universe
\eq{
    \rho\propto a^{-3(1+w)}\,,\hspace{6pt}a\propto (t-t_i)^{2/(3(1+w)))}\,,
}
where $t_i$ is an~integration constant. The~relativistic matter has the~equation of~state $w=1/3$ and~the~cosmic evolution during the~radiation-dominated epoch is given by $\rho\propto a^{-4}$ and~$a\propto(t-t_i)^{1/2}$. The~non-relativistic matter has negligible pressure $(w=0)$ and~the~evolution during the~matter-dominated era is given by $\rho\propto a^{-3}$ and~$a\propto(t-t_i)^{2/3}$.

The~accelerated expansion of~the~Universe $(\ddot a>0)$ without the~cosmological constant is possible only for~$w<-1/3$ (see Friedman equation \eqref{eq:Friedmann_2}), i.e. negative pressure. Note that in~Newtonian gravity there is no such equivalent.% The~pressure is related to~a~force associated with~a~local potential that depends on~the~position in~space but in~a~homogeneous and~isotropic universe there is no such potential.

When $w=-1$, the~energy-density $\rho$ is constant and~corresponds to~the~cosmological constant. This energy-density connected to~the~cosmological constant is
\eq{
    \rho_\Lambda=\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi G}\,.
}
With~constant energy-density, the~Friedmann equations lead to~an~exponential expansion $a\propto\exp{Ht}$.
