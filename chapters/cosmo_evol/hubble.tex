\subsection{Hubble--Lema\^{i}tre law}
During the~1920s, astronomers Slipher, Hubble, and~Str{\"o}mberg found that the~observed wavelength $\lambda_o$ of~absorption lines of~distant galaxies is larger than the~wavelength $\lambda$ in~the~rest frame \parencite{1925ApJ....61..353S,1929PNAS...15..168H}. This is because the~wavelength is stretched in~proportion to~the~scale factor in~an~expanding Universe. Although for~many years this law was known as the~Hubble's law (renamed in~2018), Lema\^{i}tre first published his research, where he derived this law, two years prior to~the~Hubble's paper (\textcite{1927ASSB...47...49L}, English translation in~\textcite{1931MNRAS..91..483L}).

The~redshift $z$ is defined as
\eq{
    z\equiv\frac{\lambda_o}{\lambda} - 1=a^{-1}-1\,.
}
In~an~expanding Universe, a~physical distance $r$ from an~observer (at~the~origin) to~an~object is given by $r=a(t)x$, where $x$ denotes the~comoving distance. For~objects which are motionless with~respect to~the~Hubble flow, the~comoving distance remains constant. Taking the~time derivative of~$r$ we obtain
\eq{
    v_H\equiv\dot r=Hr+a\dot x
}
Because of~the~cosmic expansion, more distant objects are moving faster from us with~velocity $v_H$. On~the~other hand, the~peculiar velocity $v_p\equiv a\dot x$ describes the~movement of~an~object with~respect to~the~local Hubble flow. For~small peculiar velocities and~near objects $(z\ll1)$, we obtain
\eq{
    v\sim H_0r\,,
}
which is the~law Hubble reported in~1929 by plotting the~recessional velocity $v$ versus the~distance $r$. His measurements were noisy but the~current measurements give the~Hubble constant the~value \parencite{planck_cosm}
\eq{
    H_0=(67.4\pm0.5)\rm{\ km\ s}^{-1}\rm{Mpc}^{-1}
}
