\subsection{Matter Power Spectrum}
\label{sec:pwr_spec}
In~\autoref{fig:pwr_spec_all} we show the~power spectra $P(k)$ at~redshifts $z=0$ and~$z=1.8$ for~the~different approximation schemes. The~gray areas represent variation across different realizations (different simulation runs). We see that on~large (linear) scales all approximations reproduce the~linear theory prediction. On~smaller scales, differences between the~approximations become apparent. At~the~higher redshift, the~TZA is still missing a~lot of~power due to~the~initial truncation while ZA sticks close to~the~linear predication. At~$z=0$, the~ZA loses power compared to~the~linear power spectrum on~these scales due to~shell-crossing. In~contrast, FFA and~FPA do much better and~can even partially simulate non-linear clustering.
% In~\autoref{fig:pwr_spec_all}, we used the~so-called \textit{effective time}, described in~the~following subsection, to~study the~differences in~the~\textit{shape} of~power spectra between the~individual approximations. In~the~following we will show that FFA and~FPA actually have slower growth than linear theory.

At~$z=1.8$, the~TZA is much below the~linear prediction due to~the~initial truncation whereas ZA stick close to~the~linear prediction. At~$z=0$, due to~shell-crossing, ZA filters the~power at~higher $k$, falling below the~linear power spectrum, whereas FFA and~FPA retain some features of~the~full non-linear clustering.}

% \subsubsection{Comparison with~linear theory}
% The~relative differences between power spectra and~the~linear predictions at~different redshifts are plotted in~\autoref{fig:pwr_spec_diff}. By the~linear prediction, in~this case, is meant the~initial power spectrum of~the~realization linearly evolved to~the~given epoch. The~error bars once again represent variation across different realizations but individual differences are computed from the~same realization of~the~power spectrum.

ZA predicts power spectra at~large scales very well but fails on~small scales at~later times. FFA and~FPA do not have this problem at~small scales but the~power spectrum grows more slowly across all scales. The~(CosmicEmu) non-linear power spectrum is shown in~the~upper panel for~comparison.}

% The~upper panel shows the~non-linear power spectrum $P(k)$ generated by the~CosmicEmu emulator \parencite{Heitmann:2015xma} for~comparison purposes. The~emulator predictions involve interpolations across results from a~finite number of~high-resolution simulations run with~different cosmological parameters; the~results are accurate at~the~level of~a~few percent.

% As expected, the~ZA predicts power spectra at~large scales very well but fails on~small scales at~later times. In~the~case of~FFA and~FPA, the~power spectrum growth is slower than linear theory predicts but, unlike ZA, this behavior is across all scales and~there is significantly less suppression of~power on~smaller scales.
