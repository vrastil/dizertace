\subsection{Correlation Function}
\label{sec:corr}
The two-point correlation function is defined as
\eq{
\label{eq:bao}
\xi(r)=\left\langle \delta(\mb x)\delta(\mb{x+r})\right\rangle=\int\frac{\dd^3\mb k}{(2\pi)^3}P(k)e^{i\mb{k\cdot r}}\,.
}
We computed the correlation function $\xi(r)$ for different approximation schemes at different redshifts directly from the measured matter power spectrum $P(k)$ using equation \eqref{eq:bao}. In \autoref{fig:corr_func}, we display an example of the correlation function at redshift $z=0.5$. All approximations agree reasonably with the full nonlinear predictions of the emulator for the location of the BAO peak and its width.

Individual features of the BAO peak -- location $r_0$, amplitude $A$ and width $\sigma$ -- are obtained by fitting a Gaussian to $r^2\xi(r)$ around the BAO peak
\eq{
\xi_G(r)=A\cdot e^{-(r-r_0)^2/2\sigma^2}
}
In \autoref{fig:corr_peak}, we show the these features of the BAO peak relative to the non-linear predictions of the emulator as a function of time. All approximations can predict the location of the peak with 1\% accuracy. In predicting the shape of the peak, however, they do worse -- all approximations deviate in predictions for the peak width and amplitude. Note that which approximation does best (compared to the others) for a given quantity is a function of redshift.

%From comparison with the linear theory we see that FFA and FPA are predicting something between the linear and non-linear prediction but ZA and TZA predict values quite off the linear prediction as one would expect from these approximations.
