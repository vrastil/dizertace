\chapter{Dark Energy and~Modified Gravity}
\label{chpt:de_mg}
In~this chapter we briefly introduce how we can modify Einstein's general relativity, what are reasons for~such modifications (the~cosmological constant problem), and~the~main ideas behind adding new degrees of~freedom to~the~Einstein equations. We describe one particular model of~modified gravity in~more detail -- the~$f(R)$ theory and~chameleon gravity. We will study the~behavior of~the~chameleon field in~spherical systems using numerical techniques.

Some review parts of this chapter has already been studied and described in author`s work \textcite{mastersthesis_vrastil}. In this work, we deal with the~same topic of the $f(R)$ gravity. We also use various notations and equations we already defined in~the~former work and we need them here, such as the~chameleon field $\chi$ and related equations. As we further develop the original study of the chameleon, we also took over some parts of the text (written in italics). We use the text in sections \hyperref[sec:fR]{\fR\ gravity}, \hyperref[sec_cham]{Chameleon Gravity}, and \hyperref[sec:other]{Other theories}, where a general overview of~other~interesting theories is presented. In section \hyperref[sec_cham]{Chameleon Gravity} we also extended our previous analysis of chameleon field on cosmological scales and we also extended the study of the chameleon in spherical systems on the scales of galaxy clusters.
