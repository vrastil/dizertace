\chapter{Dark Energy and Modified Gravity}
In this chapter we briefly introduce ideas behind adding new degrees of freedom to the Einstein equations, problems with the cosmological constant and we describe one particular modified gravity in more detail -- the $f(R)$ and chameleon gravity.

\section{Cosmological constant}
Standard cosmological \LCDM\ model is in a good agreement with all measurements of CMB \parencite{planck_cosm}, type Ia supernovae \parencite{Abbott_2019}, or BAO \parencite{BAO_results}. However, this concordance model has some significant fundamental problems and even though it may serve as an effective description of our Universe we should be looking for a deeper explanation of the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

\section{\textit{f(R)}-gravity}
One of the simplest modified gravity models is the so-called $f(R)$ gravity in which we consider general functions of the Ricci scalar $R$ in the action
\eq{
	\label{eq:S_fr}
	S=\frac{\Mpl^2}{2}\int\dd^4x\dg\left[F(R)\right]+S_m[\psi_m;g_\uv]\,,
}
where $F(R)=R+f(R)$ and $S_m$ is the matter action with matter fields $\Psi_m$ which are minimally coupled to gravity, i.e. they interact with gravity only through the determinant of the metric $\dg$ and the canonical kinetic term $-\frac12g^\uv\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$. The matter fields $\psi_m$ obey standard conservation equations and therefore the metric $g_\uv$ corresponds to the physical frame -- the Jordan frame.

Variation with respect to the metric $g^\uv$ gives us equation of motion
\eq{
	\label{eq:fR}
	F\R R_\uv-\frac{1}{2}f g_\uv+g_\uv\Box F\R-\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu F\R=\frac{1}{\Mpl^2}T_\uv\,.
}
For $f(R)=-2\Lambda$ the standard Einstein gravity is reconstructed. Taking the trace of \eqref{eq:fR} we get
\eq{
	\label{eq:fR_tr}
	3\Box F\R+F\R R-2F=\frac{1}{\Mpl^2}T\,.
}
We see that there is a propagating scalar degree of freedom, so-called \textit{scalaron} $F\R$ with mass $m^2=F\R/(3F\RR)$, which corresponds to the scalar field conformally coupled to matter in the Einstein frame.

To get the inflation we need a solution that approaches the de Sitter solution characterized by vacuum space with with a constant positive curvature. Thus $\Box F\R=0$ and \eqref{eq:fR_tr} becomes
\eq{
	F\R R-2f=0.
}
For example the model $f(R)=\alpha R^2$ gives rise to an asymptotically exact de Sitter solution and can be responsible for the inflation in the early Universe. The inflation ends when the quadratic term becomes smaller than the linear term. As at the present epoch is the curvature very small this model is not suitable to realize the present cosmic acceleration. Models like $f(R)=-\alpha/R^n$ with $\alpha>0,\ n>0$ could in principle give rise to the present acceleration. However, these models do not satisfy local gravity constraints because of the instability associated with negative values of $f\RR$. Moreover, the standard matter epoch is not present because of a large coupling between the Ricci scalar and the non-relativistic matter.

There are four conditions for the viability of \fR\ models \parencite{Amendola_2007}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $F\R>0\ (R>R_0)$, where $R_0$ is the Ricci scalar at the present epoch,\\
	-- required to avoid anti-gravity \parencite{2010deto.book.....A}\\
	\item $F\RR>0\ (R>R_0)$,\\
	-- required for consistency with local gravity tests \parencite{2005gr.qc.....5136O}, for the presence of the matter-dominated epoch \parencite{2007PhRvL..98m1302A} and for the stability of cosmological perturbations \parencite{2007PhRvD..75d4004S}\\
	\item $f(R)\rightarrow -2\Lambda\ (R\gg R_0)$,\\
	-- required for consistency with local gravity tests \parencite{2008PhRvD..77b3507T} and for the presence of the matter-dominated epoch \parencite{Amendola_2007}\\
	\item $0<\frac{RF\RR}{F\R}<1\ (F\R R-2f=0)$.\\
	-- required for the stability of the late-time de Sitter solution \parencite{1988PhLB..202..198M}
\end{itemize}
Some examples of \fR\ models that satisfy these conditions:
\eq{
	f(R)&=-\mu R_c(R/R_c)^p	&\mbox{for\ }&0<p<1;\ \mu,R_c>0\,,\\
	f(R)&=-\mu R_c\frac{(R/R_c)^{2n}}{(R/R_c)^{2n}+1} 	&\mbox{for\ }&n,\mu,R_c>0\,,\\
	f(R)&=-\mu R_c\left[1-(1+R^2/R^2_c)^{-n}\right] 	&\mbox{for\ }&n,\mu,R_c>0\,,\\
	f(R)&=-\mu R_c\tanh(R/R_c)	&\mbox{for\ }&\mu,R_c>0\,.
}
One of the main prediction of \fR\ gravity is different structure formation history than in \LCDM. For the large-scale structure formation on subhorizon scales \mbox{$k\gg H$} in quasi-static approximation one gets the modified equation for matter density perturbation \cite{2011RSPTA.369.4947B}
\eq{
	\ddot{\delta}_m+2H\dot{\delta}_m-4\pi G\eff \rho_m\delta_m\approx0\,,
}
where the effective gravitational constant is defined by
\eq{
	G\eff \equiv\frac{G}{1+f\R}\frac{4k^2+3a^2m^2}{3k^2+3a^2m^2}\,.
}
On scales much larger than the scalaron Compton wavelength $m_\Psi\mins$, gravity is unmodified aside from the overall reduction factor $f\R$. However, on smaller scales the gravitational coupling increases by the factor $4/3$. As the scalaron mass $m_\Psi$ and the factor $f\R$ depend on curvature (local density), the chameleon mechanism discussed earlier can prevent the detection of this effect in the Solar System.

\subsection{Hu-Sawicki \texorpdfstring{\textit{\lowercase{f}(R)}}{fR} Model}
We wish to study a class of $f(R)$ models that accelerate cosmic expansion at late times, without the cosmological constant, while satisfying both cosmological and Solar System tests. We consider the family of Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models \parencite{Hu-Saw}. The action of these models is given by \eqref{eq:S_fr} and $f(R)$ has a broken power-law form
\eq{
	f(R)=-M^2\frac{c_1(R/M^2)^m}{c_2(R/M^2)^m+1}\,,
}
where the mass scale $M^2\equiv\bar\rho_0/3\Mpl^2$, $m>0$, and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are dimensionless parameters such that at high redshifts \LCDM\ cosmology is restored.

The formulation of modified gravity in this frame leads to second-order differential equations of motion \eqref{eq:fR} for $R$ and fourth-order field equations for $g_\uv$. With a conformal transformation we may rewrite these equation in the Einstein frame with second-order differentials only \parencite[see, e.g.,][]{CHIBA20031}.

In the Einstein frame, the Hu-Sawicki models correspond to chameleon gravity with the potential
\eq{
	V(\chi) &= \Mpl^2\Lambda-\frac{\beta\bar\rho_0}{n\Mpl}\left(2\beta\Mpl\Phiscrz\right)^{1-n}\chi^n\,, \\
    V_{,\chi}(\chi) &= -\frac{\beta}{\Mpl}\bar\rho_0\left(\frac{2\beta\Mpl\Phiscrz}{\chi}\right)^{1-n}\,,
}
where $\beta=\sqrt{1/6}$ and the power-law exponent $n$ and screening potential $\Phiscrz$ are parameters of the theory. The screening potential has the following relation to the present scalaron value in $f(R)$-gravity:
\eq{
    \Phiscrz=\frac{3}{2}\ln{(1+f_{R0})}\approx\frac{3}{2}f_{R0}.
}
The extra scalar degree of freedom $\chi$ (\textit{chameleon}) obeys the equation of motion
\eq{
	\Box \chi = V_{,\chi}(\chi) + \frac{\beta}{\Mpl}\rho\equiv V_{\eff,\chi}(\chi)\,.
}
When matter moves non-relativistically and we are inside the sound horizon of the chameleon, time derivatives may be neglected, hence
\eq{
\label{eq:cham}
	\Delta \chi = \frac{\beta}{\Mpl}\rho - \frac{\beta}{\Mpl}\bar\rho_0\left(\frac{2\beta\Mpl\Phiscrz}{\chi}\right)^{1-n}
}
The transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame introduces non-standard coupling of the chameleon field to standard matter. This results in a fifth force, given in the non-relativistic limit by
\eq{
    \label{eq:cham_force}
	\dddd{\mb u_{\chi}}{a} = -\frac{3\mu}{2a}\frac{\beta}{\Mpl}\vec{\nabla}\chi \,.
}
