\chapter{Dark Energy and Modified Gravity}
\label{chpt:de_mg}
In this chapter we briefly introduce how we can modify Einstein`s general relativity, what are reasons for such modifications, and main ideas behind adding new degrees of freedom to the Einstein equations. We describe one particular model of modified gravity in more detail -- the $f(R)$ theory and chameleon gravity.

Other reasons for studying the modifications of gravity may include the following \todo{TODO citation}. Modified gravity:
\begin{itemize}
	\item can provide natural unification of the early-time inflation and late-time acceleration \todo{TODO CITE}
	\item can serve as the basis for unified explanation of dark energy and dark matter \todo{TODO CITE}
	\item be is expected to be useful in high energy physics \todo{TODO CITE}
\end{itemize}
