\chapter{Dark Energy and Modified Gravity}
\label{chpt:de_mg}
In this chapter we briefly introduce how we can modify Einstein`s general relativity, what are reasons for such modifications (the cosmological constant problem), and the main ideas behind adding new degrees of freedom to the Einstein equations. We describe one particular model of modified gravity in more detail -- the $f(R)$ theory and chameleon gravity. We will study the behavior of the chameleon field in spherical systems using numerical techniques.
