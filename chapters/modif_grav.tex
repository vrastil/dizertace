\chapter{Dark Energy and Modified Gravity}
In this chapter we briefly introduce ideas behind adding new degrees of freedom to the Einstein equations, problems with the cosmological constant and we describe one particular modified gravity in more detail -- the $f(R)$ and chameleon gravity.

Other reasons for studying the modifications of gravity may include the following TODO citation. Modified gravity can:
\begin{itemize}
	\item provide natural unification of the early-time inflation and late-time acceleration.
	\item serve as the basis for unified explanation of dark energy and dark matter
\end{itemize}
